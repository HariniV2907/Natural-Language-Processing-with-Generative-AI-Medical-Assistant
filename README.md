🩺 Natural Language Processing with Generative AI: Medical Assistant  
📄 Project Overview  
The Medical Assistant project is an AI-driven solution designed to support healthcare professionals by providing quick, accurate, and reliable medical information. With the increasing volume of medical data and research, manually searching for relevant insights can be overwhelming and time-consuming.  

This project leverages Generative AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to extract knowledge from trusted medical manuals and assist healthcare providers in making informed decisions efficiently.
